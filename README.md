Wikipedia Search
================

- Using Wikipedia's Query API with generators does not return accurately sorted search results. However, using a generator is required in order to retrieve more data including article extracts (not snippets) and images.

You can compare search results with the fast search version linked below which uses a generator. If you search using an autocomplete title, that page will almost never be the first search result.

If you know how to get accurate generator search results, I would love to know! The only workaround I found is to make individual API calls to each page title found, but this takes an additional 1-2 seconds.

- includes Gulp build scripts
